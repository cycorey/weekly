*   Language translations on-the-fly
*   Evaluate mathematical expressions
*   Base conversion of numbers
*   Search your environment variables
*   Launch a copied URL directly (`http`, `mailto`, `skype`, …)
*   Split a URL and convert its arguments to JSON
*   Switch to a running application by name
*   Hash a string (CRC32, MD5, SHA, …)
*   Generate random UUIDs, passwords, bytes sequences
*   Naturally associate a keyword to a specific item
*   Machine-specific and/or user-specific configuration in separate config files

**Properties:**

*   Plugin-oriented architecture (C++ at its core, [Python3](https://python.org) for its [plugins](glossary.html#term-plugins))
*   File-driven configuration
*   Lightning fast
*   Fairly small memory footprint

You can think of Keypirinha as an alternative to _Launchy_ and a cousin of _Alfred_.
